        Create a new MadvertiseView. You can create multiple of them, e. g. one fixed and another in a ListView.
        However, it is not recommended to use more than four of them.
        You can set the following attributes:
        textColor [color], the color your text ad's text should have. E.g. '#012'.
        textSize [integer], the size of your text ad's text. Maximum size is 20, minimum is 10.
        backgroundColor [color], the color the background of your text ads. E.g. '#012'.
        secondsToRefresh [integer], the time after which a new ad will be loaded. Minimum is 30.
        bannerType [mma|leaderboard|fullscreen|portrait|landscape|medium_rectangle|rich_media], the ad type (size) of your banner. rich_media is a special high priced format
        			that can cover the whole device screen. If rich_media is set, the placement_type is always (!) interstitial.
                    The sizes are: mma 320x53, leaderboard 728x90, fullcreen 768x768, portrait 766x66, landscape 1024x66, medium_rectangle 300x250, rich_media up to fullscreen.
        animation [fade|left_to_right|top_down], the way new ads will be animated. 'fade' is default.
        deliverOnlyText [true|false], whether your ad only displays text or not. This only has effect on mma type banners.
        placement_type [inline|interstitial], only for rich_media ads, default is inline. When declaring the placement_type as interstitial, you have to place your ad in
        			a way that it is always visible, or, in other words, can not be scrolled out of the visible part of the screen. Basically interstitial ads do always have a
        			close button, whereas inline ads might have none (if so, it's provided by the ad itself).
        mraid [boolean] whether you want to display rich media ads or not, default is true. Please make sure to overwrite onApplicationPause() and onApplicationResume()
        			in your MadvertiseCallbackListener appropriately when setting this flag to true. MRAID ads will have the initial size defined with the parameter "bannerType"
        			(see above). They can expand on a click (expanded is defined by the ad itself, which might be fullscreen).
